<h4 align="center">A little experiment in that you can grow fractal trees.</h4>

## The Options

**Pow**: how many times the next branch will be shorter than the next;

**Coef**: how long will be the trunk of the tree;

**Angle 1**: the rotation of the first (left) branch relatively to its previous;

**Angle 2**: the same as **Angle 1**, but for the second (right) branch;

**Power**: how many times the branch-drawing recursion will run;

**Start position x and y**: the position where the trunk stands;

**Starting angle (rad)**: the initial rotation of the trunk (default is up);

**Style**: the style of the branches - it can be "round", "square" or "butt".

**Boldness**: should be named "Thickness", all branches' thickness will be multiplied by this cooficient;

**Background color (HEX)**: copy the needed background color (HEX, also called RGB) with a **#** sign and you're done!
